# AddTransactionCapabilitySpec.md

## Overview
Specification for enabling live blockchain transaction execution from the TSS-generated authority address `0x0ab60f2164615B720C38c6656Eb0420D718dfef6`.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
### 1.1 Validator Network Deployment
```bash
# Deploy 7 validator nodes at specific ports
validator-0: ./validator-tss --index 0 --port 8001 --config configs/validator0.toml
validator-1: ./validator-tss --index 1 --port 8002 --config configs/validator1.toml
validator-2: ./validator-tss --index 2 --port 8003 --config configs/validator2.toml
validator-3: ./validator-tss --index 3 --port 8004 --config configs/validator3.toml
validator-4: ./validator-tss --index 4 --port 8005 --config configs/validator4.toml
validator-5: ./validator-tss --index 5 --port 8006 --config configs/validator5.toml
validator-6: ./validator-tss --index 6 --port 8007 --config configs/validator6.toml
```

### 1.2 Network Configuration
```toml
# validator*.toml updates
[ethereum]
rpc_url = "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
contract_address = "0x34c209a799b47A4ba5753E17A1Dbf2F5a612fd23"
gas_limit = 900000
max_gas_price = "50"

[validator]
key_path = "./keys/{index}/keys_{index}_{index+1}.json"
```

## Phase 2: Key Management
### 2.1 Private Key Distribution
- Distribute each `keys/validatorX/keys_X_X+1.json` to respective nodes
- Secure store with environment variable encryption:
  ```bash
  export TSS_PRIVATE_SHARE_PATH="/keys/validatorX"
  ```

### 2.2 Network Coordination
```python
# env.py
SEPOLIA_RPC = "https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"
TSS_AUTHORITY = "0x0ab60f2164615B720C38c6656Eb0420D718dfef6"
```

## Phase 3: Transaction Execution
### 3.1 Live Transaction Builder
```python
# submit_tss_confirm_mint.py
import web3
from eth_account import Account
from validator.tss import TSSSigner

w3 = web3.Web3(web3.HTTPProvider("https://sepolia.gateway.tenderly.co"))
contract = w3.eth.contract(address="0x34c209a799b47A4ba5753E17A1Dbf2F5a612fd23", abi=contract_abi)

def confirm_mint_tx(tx_secret, amount):
    # Build transaction
    txn = contract.functions.confirmMint(
        bytes.fromhex(tx_secret[2:]),
        w3.to_wei(amount, 'ether')
    ).build_transaction({
        'from': '0x0ab60f2164615B720C38c6656Eb0420D718dfef6',
        'gas': 90000,
        'gasPrice': w3.to_wei('20', 'gwei'),
        'nonce': w3.eth.get_transaction_count('0x0ab60f2164615B720C38c6656Eb0420D718dfef6')
    })
    
    # Sign with TSS signature process
    signed_txn = TSSSigner.sign(txn)
    
    # Broadcast transaction
    tx_hash = w3.eth.send_raw_transaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)
    return tx_hash

tx_hash = confirm_mint_tx('0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee13', 1.5)
print(f"TX: {tx_hash.hex()}")
```

### 3.2 Execution Commands
```bash
# Start validator network
./run_validators.sh

# Submit transaction
python3 submit_tss_confirm_mint.py \
  --secret 0xeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee13 \
  --amount 1.5
```

## Phase 4: Monitoring
### 4.1 Status Check Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
curl -s "https://sepolia.etherscan.io/api?module=account&action=txlist&address=0x0ab60f2164615B720C38c6656Eb0420D718dfef6&startblock=5112870&endblock=5112880&sort=asc&apikey=demo"
```

{<br>-"jsonrpc"</err>โ้ line 1:623 `error' at: порядк switching `<err>' and:<brдопе-new:< 427 '}> } {r>-"method"<br>-} 
```

## Required Files Structure
```
validator/
├── keys/
│   ├── 0/
│   │   └── keys_0_1.json
│   └── [1-6]/
├── submit_mint.py
├── validator-{0-6}.toml
└── run_validators.sh
```

## Success Criteria
- [x] DKG ceremony complete
- [x] Authority address generated: `0x0ab60f2164615B720C38c6656Eb0420D718dfef6`
- [x] Contract address defined: `0x34c209a799b47A4ba5753E17A1Dbf2F5a612fd23`
