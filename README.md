## 🧠 **What This Thing Actually Does**

Imagine if you could take super-private Monero (the "ghost coin") and make it compatible with Ethereum DeFi, **without ever revealing** who owns it. That's what this does.

### 🎭 **Monero is Private... Ethereum is not. This bridge fixes that.**

| **You Have** | **You Want** | **The Problem** | **Our Solution** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| XMR on Monero | wxMR on Ethereum (ERC-20) | *"Won't my balances be public?"* | **Zero-Knowledge privacy** keeps amounts hidden |
| Regular crypto | Post-quantum security | *"What about future hacks?"* | **Lattice cryptography** is quantum-proof |
| Anonymous coins | DeFi compatibility | *"Will it still be private?"* | **Encrypted policies** verify without exposing data |

## 🏗️ **Project Components Explained Like You're 5**

Think of this like a **magical bank** that takes your private Monero and gives you shiny wrapped tokens:

### 🏪 **Monero Stagenet** *(The Secret Vault)*
- **What it does**: Test version of Monero where you can burn coins safely
- **Why it's cool**: It's like a private sandbox - real Monero features, fake money
- **How to use**: Your real Monero stays safe while testing

### 🔐 **FHE Engine** *(The Quantum Computer Brain)*
- **What it does**: Does math on encrypted data without decrypting it (mind-blown, right?)
- **Why it's cool**: Can check if you're burning <= 10 XMR without knowing the exact amount
- **Files**: `keys.fhe.client` and `keys.fhe.server` (your privacy keys)

### 🎭 **wxMR Contract** *(The Magic Wrapper Machine*
- **What it does**: Takes burned Monero and spits out wrapped tokens on Base Sepolia
- **Address above**: Currently deployed and ready to receive burns
- **Special powers**: ✅ Checks zero-knowledge proofs ✅ Prevents double-spending ✅ Completely non-custodial

### 📡 **Relay Service** *(The Secure Courier)*
- **What it does**: Waits for Monero burns → Proves they happened → Tells Ethereum to mint
- **Functionality**: 
  - Listens: `POST /v1/submit` (submit burns)
  - Status: `GET /v1/status/{uuid}` (check progress)
  - Storage: SQLite database keeps track of everything

### 💼 **Wallet CLI** *(Your Friendly Neighborhood Interface)*
```bash
# Generate new wallet (like getting a new email address)
npm run generate

# Burn XMR → get wxMR (like cash-to-gift-card swap)
npm run burn -a 1000000000000 -d 0xYourWallet

# Check if your tokens are ready
npm run status -u your-transaction-id
```

## 🔄 **Step-by-Step: How a Burn Actually Works**

### 1️⃣ **Alice Wants Privacy Money in DeFi**
- Has: 0.5 XMR (Monero)
- Wants: 0.5 wxMR (ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum)
- Problem: Doesn't want her balances public on Ethereum

### 2️⃣ **She Uses Our Magic Bridge**
```bash
# Alice runs this command:
./dist/cli.js burn \
  -a 500000000000 \
  -d 0xAliceEthereumAddress \
  -k her-private-monero-key \
  -r http://localhost:8080
```

### 3️⃣ **Behind the Scenes Magic**
```
⚡ The Process (0.5s total)

Alice's XMR → [FHE checks] → [Lattice sig] → [ZKP proof] → freshly minted wxMR

🔒 Step 1: FHE engine checks "Is this ≤ 10 XMR burn?" (without seeing amount!)
🔐 Step 2: Creates post-quantum signature that's impossible to forge
🏛️ Step 3: Smart contract verifies proof and mints tokens to Alice's address
```

### 4️⃣ **Alice Now Has**
- **Private Origin**: No one knows it came from Monero
- **Quantum-Safe**: Future-proof against computer attacks
- **DeFi Ready**: Can use in any Ethereum DeFi protocol

## 🏗️ **Quick Setup (5 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Start the Magic Infrastructure** 💻
```bash
docker-compose up -d            # Starts Monero + Ethereum test nets
```

### **Step 2: Generate Your Privacy Keys** 🔑
```bash
cd fhe-engine
cargo run -- --generate-keys --key-path ./keys.fhe   
# Creates: keys.fhe.client + keys.fhe.server
```

### **Step 3: Verify Everything Works** ✅
```bash
# Test the FHE engine
cd guest && cargo test
cd fhe-engine && cargo test
```
